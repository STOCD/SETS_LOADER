# HOW SETS_LOADER WORKS
The concept is to have a single file, that would never need an update and could install all of SETS from GitHub. This is possible, but it is suggested to also require a pre-downloaded folder with the images to circumvent a very tiresome downloading process. The single file (namely #DOWNLOAD_ENVIRONMENT.bat) downloads a downloader (namely .debug\~downloader.bat), which then downloads all required files. This way the user does not have to do manual download whenever the app structure changes. It also supplies batch files to run the app and various debug files.

To make this work you have to mirror the app structure inside the three files ~app_files.txt, ~environment_files.txt and ~folders.txt. For the files simply add them each in a new line with their relative paths (backslash is used as folder seperator). ~app_files only contains the files that contain code, ~environment_files contains all files. For folders add folders each in a new line with a trailing backslash. Make sure that subfolders are below their superior folders in the file. To prevent the loader from deleting any user data like saved builds or images, the files / images are added to ~instance_stores.txt. As before, each file / folder is put in a new line with folders having a trailing backslash. Subfolders must be below their superior folders in the file. For any files and folders spaces are not supported in the name.
